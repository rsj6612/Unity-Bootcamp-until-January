EasyRoads3D Pro Add On - HD Roads

EasyRoads3D Pro, https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/easyroads3d-pro-v3-469, is required for full feature access. Please see the "HD Roads PDF" in this same folder for instructions.

EasyRoads3D Free: The package does work in the free version of EasyRoads3D, https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/easyroads3d-free-v3-987, but the side object presets are not supported in the free version. Also, the demo scene comes in Build Mode, so this scene is not editable with the Free version.
