Materials will be pink in URP and HDRP projects after importing this asset because URP and HDRP require render pipeline specific materials / shaders.

SRP Support packages are included for both URP and HDRP projects. 

These packages are located in /Assets/NatureManufacture/HD Roads/SRP Support/

Please import the package that matches best the URP or HDRP version in your project. New URP and HDRP packages are released when there are critical updates.

For HDRP projects it is important to first remove the below two shaders

/Assets/NatureManufacture/HD Roads/shaders/Standard_Metallic_Road_Shader_Parallax
/Assets/NatureManufacture/HD Roads/shaders/Standard_Metallic_Cross_Road_Shader_Parallax
